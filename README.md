# Exercise Detection and Rep Counting

This project focuses on utilizing MediaPipe for exercise detection and rep counting. It uses computer vision techniques to analyze exercise videos and provide real-time feedback.

## Overview

The project uses MediaPipe, an open-source framework developed by Google, to perform exercise recognition and rep counting tasks. By leveraging MediaPipe's pose estimation and gesture recognition capabilities, the system can accurately detect various exercises and count the number of repetitions.

## Features

- Exercise recognition using MediaPipe's pose estimation module.
- Gesture recognition for identifying specific movements during exercises.
- Repetition counting algorithm for tracking and counting exercise repetitions.
- Real-time feedback and visual overlays on the video stream.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- MediaPipe library (version X.X.X)
- Required dependencies (list any specific libraries or packages)

### Installation

1. Clone or download the project repository:


2. Install the necessary dependencies:


### Usage

1. Place the exercise videos you want to analyze in the "sample" folder.

2. Execute the main script to start the exercise detection and rep counting process:

3. The program will process each video in the "sample" folder, perform exercise recognition, count repetitions, and provide real-time feedback.
